# AutoYahtzee

Throws dice until it gets a Yahtzee.

Enter a seed value. Try to find a seed value with the fewest throws to a Yahtzee. Press [ENTER] to quit.

Inspired by Numberphile's video "1,296 and Yahtzee" available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiTwar7mFws

I'm learning Visual Studio and .NET. This is my first C# program.
